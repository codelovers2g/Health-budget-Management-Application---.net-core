Working:
So basically what happens in this application is we add particpants and their budgets. We add participants as either self managed, plan managed or ndis active.
We add Ocassion of Service for each participant selected.In the Occasion of service Date and Time Service is given to the participant. We have Support items. 
We have two cases for adding occasion of service:With Budget and without Budget. The dropdown for support item is displayed according to the participant budgets.

The we have two modes of service in occasion of service:Visit and administrative. If it is visit then we enable the km form (To track the distance travelled).
On saving the complete form we calculate the amount spent and we deduct that amount from particpant budget.

Then we have exports which shows the errors page. In the errors page we show the participants records according to expired budget or no budget for the selected 
support item or no budget remaining.We can also export these errors. We can edit these and rectify the errors by selecting the support item which is not expired and enough budget is there.
Then we have three types of export : MYOB Customers, MYOB NDIS invoices and Bulk Payment export.
If the Participant is self or plan managed then we have MYOB NDIS invoices export which shows the record of those participants who had enogh budget abd budget 
not expired.
If the Participant is NDIS Active then we have Bulk payment export which shows the record of those participants who had enogh budget abd budget 
not expired.
Then we have KMS Report which shows the record of those participants for whom there was travel.
