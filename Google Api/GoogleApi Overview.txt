In this we have integrated the following google apis:
1. Place Api
2. Distance Matrix Api
3. Geocoding Api

First we have three location fields:
1. Start Location Address
2. Service Delivery Address
3. End Location Address

1. Now using place api on all the above mentioned location fields we get the dropdown of all the suggested addresses as we start typing something in these fields as 
shown in the fig 1.1 (GoogleApi Screenshots.docx(fig1.1))

2. After filling all the three fields it will calculate the total distance with the help of distance matrix api as shown in fig 1.2 (GoogleApi.docx(fig1.2))
   E.g The distance between Airport Drive, Brisbane Airport QLD, Australia and Arndale Shopping Centre Access, Kilkenny SA, Australia is 2040 km
       and the distance between Arndale Shopping Centre Access, Kilkenny SA, Australia and Ashton Avenue, Claremont WA, Australia is 2696 km
       So on adding the above two, distance is 4736 km 

3. With this we can see the markers on the map (Geocoding Api) as shown in fig 1.2 (GoogleApi Screenshots.docx(fig1.2)).
